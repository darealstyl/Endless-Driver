# Endless Driver

This is an on-rails driving game created as a project for a game development course.

The game consists of a car that you can move left to right to avoid obstacles, that increases its speed with time. The goal is to collect as many points as possible by grabbing coins and destroying obstacles with your 'gun'.

Your travel speed affects your points multiplier, with faster speed giving a higher score multiplier.

Power-ups include automatic firing, bullet spray, and flying.

Obstacles include parked cars, pedestrians crossing the street, and helicopters that may get in the way of your ramps or become obstacles when the flying powerup is engaged.
